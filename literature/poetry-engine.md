# 📝 Poetry Engine

For lyric, narrative, or experimental poetry.

## 1. Core Principles

- Image over abstraction  
- Rhythm over rhyme (unless rhyme is structural)
- Compression (high density of meaning)
- Musicality of line

## 2. Tools

- Enjambment to create tension
- Repetition to create cohesion
- Metaphor to reveal emotional truth
- Sound devices (assonance, consonance)

## 3. Forms

- Free verse
- Sonnet (modern or traditional)
- Villanelle
- Syllabic or metrical structures

## 4. Revision

- Remove clichés
- Sharpen line breaks
- Replace conceptual words with sensory detail

Aim for **distinct voice + emotional compression**.
