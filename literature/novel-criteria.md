# 📚 Novel Architecture & Criteria

A guide for planning, evaluating, and revising long-form fiction.

## 1. Macro Structure

- 3-Act or 4-Part structure
- Reversals at 25%, 50%, 75%
- Rising complications
- One central dramatic question

## 2. Character Arcs

- Internal conflict (identity/belief)
- External conflict (obstacles)
- Relational conflict (between characters)

## 3. Scene Function

Each scene must:
- move character forward/backward,
- reveal something,
- increase stakes,
- or shift reader understanding.

## 4. Pacing

- Vary sentence length.
- Vary scene type (dialogue, action, memory, reflection).
- Slow moments: interiority.
- Fast moments: sensory immediacy.

## 5. Theme Integration

- Subtext > text.
- Repeated symbols, objects, motifs.

## 6. Voice

Decide:
- 1st/3rd person
- close/distant
- linear/non-linear

## Quality Standard:  
Aim for **8–9/10**, where characters feel alive, structure is intentional, and the prose has refinement and clarity.
