# 📖 Short Story – Criteria of Excellence (10-Point Standard)

This is your permanent 10-point system for evaluating and generating short fiction.

## 1. Emotional Core  
What the story *makes the reader feel*.  
Every story must revolve around one central feeling or tension.

## 2. Character Depth & Change  
Characters must:
- want something,
- resist something,
- and be transformed or revealed.

## 3. Voice & Tone  
The language must feel **intentional** and **specific** to the narrator or stylistic lens.

## 4. Structure & Shape  
Clear beginning → escalation → shift → resolution or resonance.  
Does not require a plot twist but must have movement.

## 5. Language & Line-Level Craft  
Clean, vivid, rhythmic, sensory.  
Remove clutter. Replace abstractions with images.

## 6. Conflict & Tension  
Interpersonal, internal, situational, symbolic — or all four.

## 7. World & Specificity  
Precise sensory detail; cultural texture; grounded setting.

## 8. Thematic Resonance  
What the story *means* beyond its events.

## 9. Economy & Focus  
No filler. Every line must earn its place.  
Cut scenes that don't serve the emotional core.

## 10. Afterglow (Memorability)  
A final line, image, or idea that lingers.

When writing or revising, aim for **8–9/10** for publishable quality.
