# 🎴 Tonality Vault – Triad Pairs Core

Core idea:  
Each tonality is built from:

- **Melodic triad** (resolution).
- **Tension triad** (carefully chosen non-triad tones).

Together they form a complete scale / set and define:

- Resolution tones.
- Tension tones.
- Available triad pairs for lines and polychords.

Use:

- For each key/tonality, define:
  - Resolution triad.
  - Tension triad.
  - Emotional function.
- Use triad alternation for melodic lines and upper-structure voicings.
