# 🪜 Tonality Vault – Tonality Arpeggios

Two layers of arpeggiation:

1. **Harmonic structure** (e.g. 1–3–5–7).
2. **Melodic structure** (melodic triad + selected tensions).

Combining them gives:

- Multiple inversion/direction variants.
- Rich arpeggio vocab that implies entire tonalities, not just chords.
