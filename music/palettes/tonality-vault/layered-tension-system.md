# ⚡ Tonality Vault – Layered Tension System

Three main tension layers:

1. **Layer 1 – Primary Quadratonic**
   - Melodic triad + 1 tension.
   - Safe, foundational colour.

2. **Layer 2 – Tension Triad & Tension Quadratonic**
   - Tension tones organised into their own triad/quadratonic.
   - Used for more urgent or dramatic colours.

3. **Layer 3 – Extended / Chromatic**
   - Full 12-tone integration via melodic bebop system and chromatic approaches.
   - Used sparingly for maximum impact.

This structure controls how "wild" a passage feels while keeping it anchored.
