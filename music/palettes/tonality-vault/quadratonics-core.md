# ♦️ Tonality Vault – Quadratonics Core

Quadratonic = **melodic triad + 1 primary tension**.

Role:

- Small, controlled colour set.
- Used for voicings and melodic fragments.
- Feeds into 3-note voicings and dyads.

Design:

- Each tonality chooses a "respectful" tension note that wants to resolve back into the triad, defining Layer 1 colour.
