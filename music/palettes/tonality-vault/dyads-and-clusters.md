# 🎚 Tonality Vault – Dyads & Clusters

Dyads (2-note cells) and small clusters extracted from quadratonics.

Use:

- Intervallic lines (seconds, fourths, tritones, etc.).
- Two-part counterpoint cells.
- Cluster-based orchestral colours (strings, winds).

They bridge between strict harmony and free texture.
