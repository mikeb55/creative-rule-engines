# 🎵 Tonality Vault – Melodic Triad System

Foundational principle:

> The melodic triad is the core structure for resolution, colour, and strong beats.

Rules:

- Strong beats favour melodic triad tones.
- Lines gravitate to this triad even in chromatic environments.
- Harmony and voicings are organised around supporting this triad.

Everything else (quadratonics, tension triads, bebop lines) grows from this.
