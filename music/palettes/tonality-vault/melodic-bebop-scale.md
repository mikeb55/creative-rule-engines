# 🎼 Tonality Vault – Melodic Bebop Scale

Concept:

- Assign 3 passing tones to each melodic triad tone.
- Design lines so strong beats land back on triad tones.
- Forcing direction changes where intervals would be too wide.

Result:

- 12-note collection with internal gravity.
- True bebop-like integration of chromaticism without losing tonality.
