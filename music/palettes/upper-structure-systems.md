# 🗼 Upper-Structure Systems

Upper structures = triads/tetrads used on top of a base chord to colour dominants, majors, minors.

Example frames:

- Over V7alt: Use major or minor triads built on ♭9, ♯9, ♯11, ♭13.
- Over maj7(#11): Upper structure major triads built on 2, 3, 5.

Function:

- Give improvisers and arrangers crisp, triad-based grips.
- Feed into voicing and line-generation engines.

Tie into Tonality Vault triad pairs to keep upper structures emotionally and functionally consistent.
