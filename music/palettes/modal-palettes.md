# 🌈 Modal Palettes

General modal colour sets:

- Ionian with colour tensions.
- Dorian with natural 9, 11, 13.
- Lydian with #11 focus.
- Phrygian / Locrian hybrids for darker colours.

Each can be mapped onto:

- Melodic triads.
- Quadratonics.
- Triad pairs.

Use for melodic/harmonic planning, not just scale lists.
