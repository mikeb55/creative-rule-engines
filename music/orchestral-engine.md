# 🎻 Orchestral Composition Engine

Purpose: provide a **workflow + rules** for symphonic / chamber orchestral pieces that achieve **9/10** by your Criteria of Excellence.

## 1. Workflow Stages

1. **Motif Definition**
   - 1–3 intervallic cells.
   - Clear registral identity.
2. **Piano / Short Score Lead Sheet**
   - 24–64 bars; 2–3 staves.
3. **Formal Map**
   - Sections with bar ranges (A, B, C, transitions).
4. **Orchestration Layers**
   - Melody, counterline, harmony, pedal/texture, colour.
5. **Detail Pass**
   - Dynamics, articulations, crescendi, hairpins, divisi.
6. **Engraving Pass**
   - Cast-off, system breaks, page turns.

## 2. Harmonic Language

- Expanded tonality, modality, extended chromaticism.
- Non-functional harmony when desired (planing, clusters, axis systems).
- Idioms:
  - **Bartók-ish**: polymodal, quartal/quintal, night music textures.
  - **Debussy/Ravel-ish**: modes, planing, extended triads.
  - **Wheeler/Schneider-ish**: Lydian, bitonality, blended jazz-classical.

## 3. Orchestration Rules

- Always know: **who has the line**, who shadows, who supports.
- Maintain registral clarity: avoid muddy mid-low blocks.
- Colour thinking:
  - Winds for colour/motif.
  - Brass for weight/affect.
  - Strings for arcs, pads, counterlines.
  - Percussion sparingly but meaningfully.

## 4. Excellence Triggers

- Motivic reference at least **every 8 bars**.
- Dynamic arcs over **full sections**, not bar-by-bar flickering.
- Avoid tutti saturation; design **contrast** (solo, chamber subsets, full orch).
- Check playability (ranges, breathing, string crossings).
