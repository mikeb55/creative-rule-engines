# 🎸 Hybrid Guitar–Chamber Engine

For ensembles like: guitar + strings + winds + flugelhorn / etc.

## 1. Ensemble Concept

- Guitar as **colour + harmony**, not just comp.
- Chamber strings & winds as **equal voices** with their own motifs.
- Hybrid jazz–classical harmony, using Tonality Vault palettes.

## 2. Workflow

1. Piano / lead-sheet reduction (melody + chords).
2. Guitar idiom check:
   - Voicings playable.
   - Positions realistic.
   - Textures: broken chords, harmonics, double-stops.
3. Orchestration:
   - Assign motif to different instruments across movements.
   - Guitar sometimes foreground, often inner voice.

## 3. Harmonic Language

- Tonality Vault based: triad pairs, quadratonics, polychords.
- Combine:
  - Mingus gospel colours,
  - Gil Evans Lydian clouds,
  - Bartók night textures.

## 4. Excellence Rules

- Guitar part is truly idiomatic (no piano-ish clusters).
- Every movement has **clear motivic connection**.
- Clarity in texture: chamber, not sludge.

Use this for projects like *The Master's Palette* or future hybrid suites.
