# 🎼 Creative Rule Engines – Music

This folder contains all **music-related rule engines, palettes, and templates** for your compositional ecosystem.

It is the *canonical source of truth* for:

- Criteria of Excellence for music
- Orchestral & chamber composition engines
- Jazz big band & hybrid large-ensemble engines
- Guitar trio & hybrid-guitar-chamber engines
- Songwriting form & harmony engines
- Engraving rules (Sibelius-oriented)
- Harmonic palettes & Tonality Vault modules
- Lead sheet & orchestration templates

All Cursor music projects should reference this repo rather than redefining rules from scratch.
