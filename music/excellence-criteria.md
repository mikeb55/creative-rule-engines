# 🎯 Music – Criteria of Excellence (0–10 Scale)

This document defines the **global musical quality standard** for all compositions, lead sheets, and orchestrations.

## Scoring Bands

- **0–2 – Broken**
  - No clear tonality, motif, or structure.
  - Would not count as a "piece" in a lesson.

- **3–4 – Rough Sketch**
  - Germs of ideas; underdeveloped, short, placeholder harmony.
  - Useful only as raw material.

- **5–6 – Functional / Average**
  - Coherent but generic; some motivic connection.
  - Passable as homework draft, *not* performance-ready.

- **7 – Good Student Work**
  - Clear motifs, some development, workable form.
  - Teacher says: "Good – now develop it."

- **8 – Strong / Emerging Professional**
  - 24–32+ bars of real structure.
  - Motivic development across sections, non-generic lines, modern harmony.
  - Ready to orchestrate or refine.

- **9 – Artist-Level Excellence (Target)**
  - Strong emotional arc, deep motivic logic.
  - Rich, stylistically aware harmony.
  - Idiomatic writing, human rhythm, clean engraving.
  - Ready for performance, recording, or publication.

- **10 – Mastery**
  - Level of major composers in the relevant idiom (Shorter, Bartók, Gil Evans, Wheeler, etc.).
  - Rare, not required for every project; aim here only occasionally.

## Core Dimensions (for self-scoring)

1. **Motivic Identity & Development**
2. **Melodic Line (contour, singability, character)**
3. **Harmonic Language (colour, logic, depth)**
4. **Formal Shape (length, proportion, pacing)**
5. **Rhythm & Feel (human, expressive)**
6. **Texture & Orchestration Consciousness**
7. **Idiomatic Writing (instrument-specific)**
8. **Engraving & Clarity (for performers)**
9. **Emotional / Narrative Arc**
10. **Afterglow (memorability)**

Use this when refining: if any axis is clearly under 7, the piece is not yet "excellent" and needs another pass.
