# 🎺 Jazz Big Band Arranging Engine

A Feifke-inspired "Lead Sheet to Large Ensemble" pipeline.

## 1. Band Model

Default: 17-piece big band
- 5 saxes, 4 trombones, 4 trumpets, rhythm section (pno/gtr, bass, drums).

## 2. Pipeline Stages

1. **Word Sketch**
   - Mood, references, emotional arc, soloists, form.
2. **Lead Sheet**
   - 32+ bar form, full chord symbols, melodic clarity.
3. **Event Map**
   - Section-by-section events (tutti hits, backgrounds, solos, shout).
4. **Section Orchestration**
   - Saxes / Bones / Trumpets voicing strategies per section.
5. **Shout Chorus Design**
   - Motivic, rhythmic, not just "louder."
6. **Rhythm Section Plan**
   - Groove, comping density, bass shape, drum figures.
7. **Engraving Checklist**
   - Layout, cues, part clarity.

## 3. Voicing Concepts

- Drop-2, drop-2&4, spread, cluster, mixed.
- Lead-protective voicings (no harsh seconds around lead).
- Shout chorus: use **motivic development**, not random chromatic runs.

## 4. Criteria of Excellence

- Shout solves a **real musical problem** (climax, release).
- Backgrounds support solos melodically, not just pads.
- Clear contrast between sections (density, texture, register, time feel).

Use this engine plus specific Feifke-style prompting in Cursor for big band projects.
